# suckless-dwm-blue
The suckless dwm window manager is known to be difficult to patch. Users are generally capable of integrating a few patches with ease, however, the patches may be difficult to merge and would sometimes conflict each other. 

This is a patch of dwm featuring mainly barpadding, colorbar, fullgaps, hide vacant tags, status2d, systray and winicon patches.

As of current, this project is in the making.
